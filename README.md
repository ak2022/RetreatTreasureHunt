Can you find the treasure??? Clone this repo locally and try and get the treasure back home safely using ONLY shell commands.

To win, you will need to find the treasure chest, the key, and the program to open it! They will need to be taken safely back to your ship.
You can then use the script to open the treasure chest... 

You will also need to provide a copy of your shell commands to proove that you never used your mouse!!! This can be done by typing 'history n' where n is the number of steps it took you to get the treasure.

Good luck!

_hint_ A vist to Long John Silver may help!
